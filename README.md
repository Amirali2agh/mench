ensch Multiplayer Game Backend

A robust, real-time multiplayer backend for the classic board game **Mensch** (Ludo-style). Built with Python (**FastAPI**), **Redis** for state caching and matchmaking queue management, and asynchronous **WebSockets** for high-frequency game interactions.

---

## Features

- **Matchmaking Queue:** Dynamic, Redis-backed matchmaking queues supporting both 2-player and 4-player lobbies.
- **Dynamic Piece Counts:** Players can choose to customize matches and play with 2, 3, or 4 pieces.
- **Stateful Game Engine:** Complete Mensch gameplay rule verification (rolling, entering track, capturing, private home-stretch logic, and win-condition checks).
- **Graceful Reconnection:** Tracks player connection state. If a player disconnects, an asynchronous 60-second countdown forfeit timer starts. Reconnecting within 60 seconds cancels the forfeit and resumes play.
- **Dockerized Architecture:** Orchestrates both the FastAPI web application and the Redis cache service in isolated networks with simple docker-compose setups.
- **High-Speed Iranian Mirror Configuration:** Pre-configured Dockerfile utilizing local PyPI mirrors for fast, barrier-free container builds inside Iran.
- **Robust Test Coverage:** Integrated test suite with mocked database engines verifying matchmaking, connection lifecycles, and core mathematics of the Mensch board.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Docker Desktop** installed and running on your host machine, with the **WSL 2 Integration** enabled in the Docker Desktop settings.

### Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

To build and launch both the FastAPI backend server and the Redis database container, run the following command in the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
Server base URL: http://localhost:8000
WS Server URL: ws://localhost:8000
Verify Server Health
Once the containers are running, navigate to http://localhost:8000/health in your browser. You should receive a healthy response confirming Redis connectivity:
code
JSON
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "redis": "ok"
}
Running the Test Suite Locally
If you are developing locally inside WSL and want to run the test suite:
Activate your virtual environment:
code
Bash
source .venv/bin/activate
Execute Pytest:
code
Bash
pytest
The test runner will automatically collect and execute all 16 unit and integration tests across routers, managers, and service files.
